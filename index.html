     <h3> Content Writing, Video Editing and Animation</h3> 
     <p> * Animation is the rapid display of a sequence of images that create an illusion of movement. The effect is an optical illusion of motion created by the phenomenon of persistence of vision, and can be achieved in several ways, the most common being as a motion picture or video.

        
        * Animation has been about since before the web began, enhancing visual content and, in many cases, animation is used to highlight the interface. Today, animation is not just part of a websites content, itâ€™s a fundamental feature, essential to increasing interaction with the site.</p>
